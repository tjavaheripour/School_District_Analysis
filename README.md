python - pandas
## Overview
This analysis project is to prepare standardized test data for analysis in order to gain insights about school performance trends and patterns to help the school board make strategic decisions regarding school budgets and priorities. We have considerations for the FERPA regarding data confidentiality.  
The school board has notified analyst about evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. We are asked to replace the math and reading scores of that school with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.  We also require to measure the impact of these changes on the overall analysis.This report should include:

- The district summary
- The school summary
- The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
- The average math score for each grade level from each school
- The average reading score for each grade level from each school
- The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type

## Results
